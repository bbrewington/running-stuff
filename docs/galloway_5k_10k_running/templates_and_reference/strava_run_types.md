# Strava Run Types

- **Run**: This is the standard activity type for Runs.
- **Race**: Use this activity type when you're running against the clock.  Resting time is not factored into your performance metrics in favor of Elapsed Time, and activities will default to 'Race Analysis' instead of 'Overview.'
- **Long Run**: Use this category to denote your long runs.
- **Workout**: Running intervals or on a track? Use the Workout tag.
