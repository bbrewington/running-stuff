# Acceleration-Glider Drill ("ACG")

From Galloway 5K/10K Running, p. 81-82

Notes:
- Form of speed-play (a.k.a. "fartlek")
- helps develop range of speeds & ability to move from one to next
- Key benefit: learn how to glide (a.k.a. coast off of momentum)

Requirements:
- Warm up at least half mile
- No sprinting - never run all-out

Core of Drill:
1. 15 steps: Jog very slowly
1. 15 steps: Jog faster (increasing to regular running pace)
1. 15 steps: Ramp up to race pace
1. Glide or coast - allow yourself to gradually slow down to jog using momentum...see how many steps you can go as a glide
