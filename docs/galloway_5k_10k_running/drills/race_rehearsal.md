# Race Rehearsal ("RR")

- Prepare for pacing during goal race
- Look at watch at end of each lap --> goal is to hit exact time
- Each RR workout will have 2 segments:
  1. Run 1st segment: goal pace
  1. 5 minute walk
  1. Run 2nd segment: 1-2 sec per lap faster than goal pace, without struggling

Note: if, due to heat or whatever else, if you can't do this without struggling, break workout into more segments
