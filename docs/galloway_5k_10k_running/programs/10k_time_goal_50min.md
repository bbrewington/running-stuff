# 10k: Time Goal 49:59 (i.e. 50 min)

From Galloway 5K/10K Running, p. 68-69

## Notes
- Wednesday's speed workout of 400 repetitions should be run at 1:51 each
- Long runs should be run no faster than 12 min per mile for quick recovery (adjust for temp w/ )
- If long run is not up to the distance of the first long run on the schedule, gradually increase to this length before beginning the program
- Goal times for Monday's RR time trials are in parentheses
- Total mileage for MM days is listed with "total" at end (MM is embedded into the middle of the mileage)
- Stay smooth at the end of the speed session, even when tired; it's ok to slow down 1-3 seconds, during the last 2 repetitions
