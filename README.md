# running-stuff

This all started in Summer 2022 by making a foolish bet over Coors Light on a pontoon boat that I could run the 2023 Atlanta Peachtree Road Race 10k in 50 minutes (mile pace as m:ss - 8:02)

Pretty heavily drawing from the book "Galloway's 5K/10K Running" (see folder docs/galloway_5k_10k_running), and planning on including docs, templates, and glue code for working with the data I'm tracking (e.g. data pipeline for Strava API --> BigQuery)

Mainly setting this up because I learn in outlines, and so I can create my personalized plan, and quickly copy+paste the instructions for the drills and stuff (and so it's easy to link to content here)
